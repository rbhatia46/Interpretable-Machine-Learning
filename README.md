# Interpretable-Machine-Learning
In this project, I worked on Interpreting the results generated on a Financial dataset for a Binary Classification problem. Mainly, there are 2 frameworks used in this project, i.e., [eli5](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5) and [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).

* ELI5 works well on simple models(white-box models).
* LIME(Model Agnostic) on the other hand can be used to interpret any type of model of any complexity(black-box models).
